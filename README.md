&lt;blink>

### Enables the `<blink>` tag in modern browsers.

Well, W3C may recommend against blinking text due to [accessibility guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/cp0303/0303-CSS-BLINK.html), and apparently all modern browsers have removed the `text-decoration: blink` CSS property and `<blink>` tag support.

But you, like me, know how important this functionality is. After all, what calls more attention than **FULL CAPS BOLD BLINKING TEXT**?  
(okay, imagine that the full caps text is blinking, I can't hack JS or `<style>` into a github markdown file afaik)

Just for fun. Yes, you may actually include this in your CSS reset if you'd like.
